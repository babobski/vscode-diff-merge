üëÇ**I would love to hear your feedback to improve this tool**

Found a bug? Have an extra ordinary idea? Please create an [issue](https://github.com/moshfeu/vscode-diff-merge/issues/new)

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èNotice that I (and seems that many others) couldn't find an easy way to implement such feature. Therefor, the user experience may not be perfect. The colors, fonts, icons, shortcuts and cetera may not be the same as vscode's. I'll do our best to match the experienc though.

- ~~File not supported in diff view~~
- ~~Copy from left deleted lines, replace the row with empty row instead of removing it completely~~
- Context menu shows up for non text based files (binary etc.)
- Diff editors theme has different look & feel than current theme ([monaco is not fully competiable with vscode theme](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor/issues/675#issuecomment-363151951))
- [API limitation] For single comparing - left editor is not editable
